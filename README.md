# Arduino Projects

About:

I have never messed with arduino anytime before this repo. I found it to be very interesting and fun! It was a struggle at first due to the fact that It takes a little more effort than just straight coding haha. 

I had to make a clock for one of my CS classes. In this repo is a warmup file that I used to get the feel for the arduino language and how to upload it to the UNO.
